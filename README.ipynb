The code will be presented separately in the repository in the file `model.py` and different packages will be used to process training data gathered from Udacity's simulator. Images gathered will be extended to provide better traininig. Images were saved to an S3 bucket to provide access from multiple computers to craft the model separately from the training instance.\n",
